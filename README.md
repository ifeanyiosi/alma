## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm Ifeanyi Osi-Okeke, a skilled front-end developer with 4 years of experience specializing in building dynamic and responsive web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I have a passion for creating intuitive user interfaces and optimizing web performance. With a strong background in both development and customer service, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and user-centered design to every project I undertake.


## Installation

Install my-project with npm run dev
```
    
## Optimizations

Lazy Loading: Used Next.jsâ€™s built-in <Image /> component for automatic lazy loading of images. This improves page load times by loading images only when they enter the viewport.

SEO Enhancements:

Sitemap: Generated a sitemap to help search engines crawl and index the site more effectively.
<Head /> Component: Utilized Next.jsâ€™s <Head /> component to manage and optimize meta tags, titles, and descriptions for better search engine visibility.
Robots Meta Tags: Implemented robots meta tags to guide search engine crawlers on which pages to index and which to avoid.
